<p>When learning a new game, the curse of knowledge (not knowing every card yet, combos, etc) is one of the things that separates new players from good players. In card games, this is often based around removal or big plays to be aware of. I've documented some (not all) of the removals/plays to be aware of by faction for when you're playing!</p>

<p>If you're simialr to me and have just recently gotten started, building your card collection is key! You're in look, Duelyst is incredibly generous in the amount of cards you can earn and their Core set drop rates. Below is how you can quickly start building up your collect:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get every hero to level 10 in practice. Then get them to level 11 (requires about 2 ranked games) so you've unlocked all heroes as well.</li>
  <li>Play all the solo challenges. Each solo challenge gives you gold.</li>
  <li>Play 4 games a day (the quests) on ladder. That alone will tend to net you at least one pack, sometimes more worth of gold.</li>
  <li>Not dissimilar to Hearthstone, once you're more comfortable, Gauntlet tends to be a better investment of gold (150) if you can get even around 3 wins. If you can "go infinite" (get enough gold from winning to pay for your next) then you're basically set for building your collection.</li>
  <li>Play ladder. There tends to be different rewards you get just for playing as well that net you gold.</li>
</ol>
