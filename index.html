<p>I put together this page as a newer duelyst player myself with a lot of questions. I've seen and recieved many of the same sort of questions, so I figured I'd go ahead and share the knowledge! Hope you find the page helpful, and if you have the time, <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/pyrogunx">feel free to come hang out and watch some duelyst on twitch</a>!</p>

<p>If you're simialr to me and have just recently gotten started, building your card collection is key! You're in look, Duelyst is incredibly generous in the amount of cards you can earn and their Core set drop rates. Below is how you can quickly start building up your collect:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get every hero to level 10 in practice. Then get them to level 11 (requires about 2 ranked games) so you've unlocked all heroes as well.</li>
  <li>Play all the solo challenges. Each solo challenge gives you gold.</li>
  <li>Play 4 games a day (the quests) on ladder. That alone will tend to net you at least one pack, sometimes more worth of gold.</li>
  <li>Not dissimilar to Hearthstone, once you're more comfortable, Gauntlet tends to be a better investment of gold (150) if you can get even around 3 wins. If you can "go infinite" (get enough gold from winning to pay for your next) then you're basically set for building your collection.</li>
  <li>Play ladder. There tends to be different rewards you get just for playing as well that net you gold.</li>
</ol>

  <tr>
    <th>Faction</th>
    <th>Hearthstone Equivalent</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Songhai</td>
    <td>Mage / Rogue</td>
    <td>Songhai to me has been a combination of a mage and rogue. You can go full spells and have a lot of options for direct damage with it, but then you also have the more "stealth" like options with backstab as well as a lot of maneuverability spells.</td>
  </tr>

<p>I played Hearthstone quite a bit, but I can honestly tell you that while positioning mattered in HS, it is critical in Duelyst. I can honestly say that I've won games against better decks with better cards just because of having better positioning throughout the game. Here's a few videos I found helpful around positioning:
<ol>
  <li>Your opening hand, what you mulligan, and how you position yourself for the first 2 - 3 moves is critical. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjh1BRAqqIk">This video on Openings</a> will hopefully help you improve that.</li>
  <li>Positioning for control is also critical.</li>
  <li>The Duelyst blog itself also has a <a href="https://news.duelyst.com/positioning-202-conservative-combat/">great article</a> on positioning to avoid removal.</li>
</ol>
