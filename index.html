<p>I put together this page as a newer duelyst player myself with a lot of questions. I've seen and recieved many of the same sort of questions, so I figured I'd go ahead and share the knowledge! Hope you find the page helpful, and if you have the time, <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/pyrogunx">feel free to come hang out and watch some duelyst on twitch</a>!</p>

<p>
  Below are decks I've ran and had success with. They are not going to be as perfected as some of the decks that you see S-Rank players, but these are decks I've climbed with.
<ol>
  <li>Vetruvian pseud-budget. Ran this deck from 30 (started this month) to around 16.</li>
  <li>Vetruvian Midrange 2. Ran this from 16 to around 11 and then my win rate wasn't as good.</li>
  <li>Lyonar Counter. This deck is heavy taunt and dispel oriented - tends to counter well a lot of the meta right now. Used this from around 12 - 10.</li>
  <li>Creepy Cassyva. This deck is focused on creep combos. It's a more expensive deck and not perfected, but I got a decent winrate with it.</li>
</ol>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Decks</h3>

<p>
  Below are decks I've ran successfully, or those that I've seen played that are effective. See the notes of each deck for more info.

  <li><a href="https://forums.duelyst.com/t/ryanhs-decks-for-every-general-shimzar/3288">Check out Ryan's post on Duelyst forums.</a> He does a nice job outlining budget decks for each general. If you're curious on other picks and feedback, the comments on the post are great as well.</li>
